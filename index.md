	<p>I am a Senior Engineer working for at 'Platform Advanced Research Lab' of Samsung SDS, a new lab that started in Dec 2020.

  <p>
  I have a variety of backgrounds including <strong>mechanical engineering</strong>(B.E.), <strong>mathematics</strong>(Ph.D.), and <strong>software development</strong>. Because of these experiences, I see the big picture of the problem like a mechanical engineer, I analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and I write code like a software engineer. My goal is to solve real-world problems using advanced mathematics and scientific computing.
