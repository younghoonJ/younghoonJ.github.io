<div id="description container">
	<p>I am a Senior Engineer working for the Analytics platform Lab of Samsung SDS. At SDS, I develope Brightics A.I. and contribute to an open-source software Brightics Studio. 
  </p>
  <p>
  I have a variety of backgrounds including <strong>mechanical engineering</strong>(B.E.), <strong>mathematics</strong>(Ph.D.), and <strong>software development</strong>. Because of these experiences, I see the big picture of the problem like a mechanical engineer, I analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and I write code like a software engineer. My goal is to solve real-world problems using advanced mathematics and scientific computing.
