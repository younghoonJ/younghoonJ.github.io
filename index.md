	<p>I am a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong> working for at <strong>Platform Advanced Research Lab</strong> of <strong>Samsung SDS</strong>, a new lab that started in Dec 2020. Prior to joining the current lab, I developed a data analysis workflow tool called <strong>Brightics A. I.</strong> and contributes to the open-source software <strong>Brightics Studio</strong> as a team member of <strong>Analytics platform lab</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have a variety of backgrounds including <strong>mechanical engineering</strong>(B.E.), <strong>mathematics</strong>(Ph.D.), and <strong>software development</strong>. Because of these experiences, I see the big picture of the problem like a mechanical engineer, I analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and I write code like a software engineer. My goal is to solve real-world problems using advanced mathematics and scientific computing.
