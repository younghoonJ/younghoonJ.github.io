## Description
**Younghoon Jung, Ph.D.**, is a **Senior Engineer** working at **Platform Advanced Research Lab** of **Samsung SDS**. Prior to joining the current lab, he developed a data analysis workflow tool called **Brightics A. I.** and contributes to the open-source software **Brightics Studio** as a team member of the **Analytics platform lab**.

**Younghoon Jung** has a variety of backgrounds including **mechanical engineering**, **mathematics**, and **software development** which allows him to understand the big picture of the problem like a mechanical engineer, analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and write a code.

**Younghoon Jung** holds a **Ph.D. in Mathematics** from the **KAIST**, Korea. During his Ph.D. he researched Interface problems, in particular, he developed **a new geometric series solution method** for harmonic problems based on the geometric function theory that applies to a domain of very arbitrary shape. This research result proves his creativity and persistence.
