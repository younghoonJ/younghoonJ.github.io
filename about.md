## Description
Younghoon Jung, Ph.D., is a Senior Engineer working for the Analytics platform Lab of Samsung SDS. He develops a Data Analytics Workflow tool called Brightics A. I. and contributes to an open-source software Brightics Studio.

Younghoon Jung has a variety of backgrounds including mechanical engineering, mathematics, and software development which allows him to understand the big picture of the problem like a mechanical engineer, analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and write a code.

Younghoon Jung holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the KAIST, Korea. During his Ph.D. he researched Interface problems, in particular, he developed <strong>a new geometric series solution method</strong> for harmonic problems based on the geometric function theory that applies to a domain of very arbitrary shape. This research result proves his creativity and persistence.
