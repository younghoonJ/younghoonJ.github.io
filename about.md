## Description

**Younghoon Jung** is an engineering-minded **Math Ph.D.** who works for the **Platform Advanced Research Lab** of **Samsung SDS**.

Before joining the current lab, Younghoon developed a data analysis workflow tool called the **Brightics A. I.** and contributed to an open-source software called the **Brightics Studio** as a member of the **Analytics platform lab**.

**Younghoon** has a variety of backgrounds including **mechanical engineering (BE)**, **mathematics (Ph.D.)**, and **software development**, which allows him to understand the grand scheme of the underlying problem like a mechanical engineer, analyze the principal details like a mathematician, and write code like a software engineer.

**Younghoon Jung** holds a **Ph.D. in Mathematics** from the **KAIST**, Korea. During his Ph.D. he researched Interface problems,  During his Ph.D. he researched Interface problems and wrote several journal papers. In particular, he developed **a new geometric series solution method** for harmonic problems based on the geometric function theory that applies to a domain of very arbitrary shape. This research work proves his talents, creativity, and persistence.

He aims to solve real-world problems using advanced mathematics and scientific computing.
